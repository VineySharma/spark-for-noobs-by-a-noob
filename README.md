# iPython Notebooks to Practice Spark

I've created these iPython notebooks while learning PySpark. Though I've provided some explanation on some of the basic concepts of Spark, such explanations by no means should be construed as complete. In fact, I'd appreciate if people following it can provide me some feedback so that I can make necessary correction. 

A big thanks to [this](https://github.com/jadianes/spark-py-notebooks) tutorial which too was created with the same intent. It helped me a lot to understand the concepts by giving me something to play around with. Additionally, thanks to numerous quora users who explain the technical jargons in the most lucid terms. 

# Spark Installation Notes
I partially followed [this](https://medium.com/@GalarnykMichael/install-spark-on-ubuntu-pyspark-231c45677de0) link to install Spark. Following are the steps which I didn't follow:
* As opposed to using Anaconda distribution for Python, I went ahead with the installation which comes with Ubuntu. I am not a huge fan of *Anaconda* and prefer to install the Python libraries as and when required. 
* I installed Spark 2.2.0.
* Note that this version of Spark, does not work with Oracle Java 9. It works with Java 8. While installing Java, you'll be prompted to install version 9. DO NOT install 9. It took me almost 2 hours to find this out.
